--  PROBLEM 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  The Wasatch Cupcake Shop is getting ready to send 
--    a marketing email announcing a new promotion on 
--    Funfetti cupcakes. We need to get all of our 
--    customers’ email addresses to Marketing.

--  Select all of the email addresses from the customers 
--    table in alphabetical order.
SELECT email 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY email ASC;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  PROBLEM 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  Elizabeth Crocker has requested receipts for all of her past 
--    cupcake orders. To look up the receipts, we need to know 
--    which orders Elizabeth placed.

--  Write a query that lists the order ids for all orders placed 
--    by customers with the first name Elizabeth and last name 
--    Crocker. Use a SUBQUERY to do this, not a join.
SELECT id 
FROM orders 
  WHERE customer_id = 
    (SELECT id 
    FROM customers 
		WHERE fname='Elizabeth' AND lname='Crocker');

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  PROBLEM 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  Employees need to be scheduled for next week based on how 
--    many cupcakes have been ordered and not yet processed.

--  Write a query that gets the total number of cupcakes from 
--    unprocessed orders.
SELECT SUM(num_cupcakes) 
FROM orders
WHERE processed=false;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  PROBLEM 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  Management needs an inventory report. They want to know how 
--    many cupcakes have been ordered of each type.

--  Write a query that shows the name of each cupcake and the sum 
--    of cupcakes ordered for that cupcake type (for both 
--    processed and unprocessed orders), sorted in ascending 
--    alphabetical order of cupcake name.

--  The report should show all cupcake types, even if they have 
--    not been ordered at all.
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.num_cupcakes) AS sum
FROM cupcakes AS c
	LEFT JOIN orders AS o
		ON c.id = o.cupcake_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY c.name ASC;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  PROBLEM 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  Marketing now wants to send an email to its top customers, 
--    thanking them for their business and offering them a 
--    special deal for next month.

--  Write a query that shows the email address of each customer 
--    and the total number of cupcakes they’ve ordered. Results 
--    should be sorted by total number of cupcakes, in descending 
--    order.
SELECT email, SUM(o.num_cupcakes) AS total
FROM customers AS c
	LEFT JOIN orders AS o
		ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY email;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  PROBLEM 6
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--  Uh oh — it looks like there might have been an issue with a 
--    recent batch of funfetti cupcakes (someone might have 
--    ordered non-edible sparkles to put in the icing instead of 
--    edible ones). We need to let our customers who have 
--    processed orders of funfetti cupcakes know about the issue.

--  Write a query that selects the first name, last name and 
--    email address of customers who have processed orders of 
--    funfetti cupcakes. Even if a customer has multiple 
--    outstanding orders of funfetti, their email should only 
--    appear once.
SELECT DISTINCT fname, lname, email
FROM customers AS c
	LEFT JOIN orders AS o
		ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.processed=true AND o.cupcake_id=
	(SELECT id 
    FROM cupcakes 
		WHERE name='funfetti')
GROUP BY fname, lname, email, o.id;
